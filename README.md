# nCOVnet-with-5foldCV

In this project I recreated the nCOVnet model from the following paper -

Harsh Panwar, P.K. Gupta, Mohammad Khubeb Siddiqui, Ruben Morales-Menendez, Vaishnavi Singh, Application of deep learning for fast detection of COVID-19 in X-Rays using nCOVnet, (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096007792030343X)

Unlike the researchers, however, I also employed 5-fold cross validation.
